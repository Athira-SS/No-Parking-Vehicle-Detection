No-Parking Vehicle Detection (NPVD) 

With decreasing costs of high quality surveillance systems, human activity detection and tracking has become increasingly practical. Accordingly, automated systems have been designed for numerous detection tasks, but the task of detecting illegally parked vehicles has been left largely to the human operators of surveillance systems. We propose NPVD for detecting this event in realtime by applying a novel image processing system that can perform the job quite easily and efficiently. After event detection, we extract the number plate (or otherwise called license plate) data for further processing. The proposed program is able to successfully recognize illegally parked vehicles in real-time and impose fine as per the traffic law in india.
